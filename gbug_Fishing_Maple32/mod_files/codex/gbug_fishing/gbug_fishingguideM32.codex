  "Welcome back everyone, your favourite angler Emi here again with another addition of  ^#b9c932;The Hunter's Guide to Fishing^white;, the only zine with all the juicy tips you need to fish like a floran!

I've fished in some pretty interesting places, but one of my favourites was quite different to the rest; a giant lake in humongous cavern, deep under a stinky old industrial planet!", 

"I met a nuu down there who explained to me that this big aquifer is pumped up for some fancy factory stuff near the surface or something, I don't really remember, BUT he had some interesting fishing tales!

People around there live along the roof of the cavern, and cast down with extra-long lines into the darkness. They showed me these cool rods they use made of some something called 'vivatin'.",  

"Caves like these are common on a number of different planets supposedly, and while the fish themselves weren't too out of the ordinary, it's definitely a sight worth seeing! Watch out for the batongs though :Э"
