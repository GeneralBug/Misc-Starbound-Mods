	"description"		"Adds a bubble helmet! Wow! You can put it on your head and stuff. Currently found in the vanilla costume loot pool or you can spawn it in with gbug_bubblehelm. Actually I'm not 100% sure it does actually spawn as I couldn't find it when testing but the odds of any given item are very slim so let me know if you find it naturally."
