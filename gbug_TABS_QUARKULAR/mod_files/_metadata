  "description" : "Changes the quarkular furnaceto use the same interface as the regular one and reimplements it's salvage tab with Many Tabs, thus making it compatible with other Many-Tabs-based furnace addons and fun interface stuff like Extended GUI and Filter by Rarity.\n\nThe one downside to this is that all furnace tiers will have an empty salvage tab, but I don't know if you can set it up to only appear on a given tier without overriding the whole interface like it did originally anyway.",
