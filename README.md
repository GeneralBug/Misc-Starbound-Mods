# Misc-Starbound-Mods
My various Starbound mods, published [on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198163788245/myworkshopfiles/?appid=211820&p=1&numperpage=30)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR WHEN I FORGET AGAIN:
1. Update metadata_
2. Pack mod_files into a .pak located in contents, using asset_packer found in Starbound folder
3. Using SteamCMD, login and use workshop_build_item \<path to metadata.vdf\>
4. Add patch notes on the page
