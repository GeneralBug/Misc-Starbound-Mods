  "Welcome everyone to the first issue of ^#b9c932;The Hunter's Guide to Fishing^white;, where I, your favourite angler Emi, will give you all the juicy tips you need to fish like a floran!

So you've got yourself a rod, you cast out into the nearest puddle, and... nothing! Well the first and best tip I can give is to pick the right spot; can't catch anything if there's nothing to catch!", 

"You'll want to get yourself to the nearest watery world; that's where all the big guys school. Cast far and deep, and you should start seeing some movement after a little while! You'll find you can move the hook around a bunch, so make sure you're as deep or shallow as you want for whatever you're going for.",

"Be patient, and when your prey starts biting, reel in but watch out if they start struggling; your line can only take so much before breaking. Once you've gotten them nice and beached, that's when you go for them, and reward yourself with the sweet taste of victory! Unless of course you're not feeling too hungry right now, then just guide the little guy back into some water and watch them swim away :Э",

"An extra tip; if all you're seeing is boring old mudchomps, try reeling your hook in and out a bunch; it sturs up the water and can attract a new set of fish to see what you're up to!"
