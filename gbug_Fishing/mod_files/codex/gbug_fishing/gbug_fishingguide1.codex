  "Welcome back everyone, your favourite angler Emi here again with another addition of ^#b9c932;The Hunter's Guide to Fishing^white;, the only zine with all the juicy tips you need to fish like a floran!

I get a lot of readers mailing in asking about all sorts of things - what kind of bait do hoopfish like, how do I clean the poison off a chordopod, why does my lure keep catching fire - but a lot of you keep asking about me! So let me tell you all about your favourite angler Emi :Э",

"It all started when I was a sprout, the only floran living in a little hylotl village on a distant little ocean world that shall remain nameless. It was really nice and cool and everything, but there was one key thing every growing floran needs; a good hunt! Of course my parents taught me heaps about writing and numbers and stuff, but they didn't know the first thing about hunting...",
"...so they decided they could teach me the next best thing! It wasn't long before I became a master angler (maybe the best ever, if I do say so myself), saw the universe, then got the idea to settle down a little! What's the point of being the best if nobody else knows it, right? So I started my little break to write all these, and here we are today :Э"
