[*]Terramart!
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2737514021&searchtext=terratabs]Terratabs[/url]! (both versions of the floran shopkeeper and interface icons)
[*]Vanilla and Many Tabs codex tab icons (also new character creation icons because I didn't realise the original had them because another mod ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3546647977]OpenUI[/url]) was overriding them but I already made them so now you're getting them anyway)
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791208641]Wearable Pet Collars[/url]!
